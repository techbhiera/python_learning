# This is my learning module  project on python 
#### my name is Abhishek Sharma , I am a data scientist currently learning new libraries of python for deep learning and machine learning 

Here’s an explanation of each **library and package** in your `data-analysis-env` Conda environment YAML file — specifically tailored for **data analysis with Python**:

---

## 🧪 `name: da_env.yml -this is the file name of conda environment which gonna help u to create environment.`

This is the **name of the environment** you’re creating. You’ll create it using:

```bash
conda env create -f da_env.yml

```
This is the **name of the environment** you’re creating. You’ll activate it using:

```bash
conda activate dataanalysis2.0
```

## 📦 `channels:`

These are the sources from which packages will be downloaded:

### 🔹 `defaults`

* The default Conda channel (stable, official packages).

### 🔹 `conda-forge`

* A community-maintained channel with more up-to-date versions of packages, especially for data science.

---

## 📚 `dependencies:`

These are the Python packages that will be installed into your environment:

### 🔹 `python=3.10`

* Specifies the Python version (3.10 is fast and stable, ideal for most projects).

---

## ✅ **Data Manipulation & Core Math**

### 🔹 `pandas`

* Powerful library for **data wrangling**, cleaning, filtering, joining, and analysis using **DataFrames**.

### 🔹 `numpy`

* Foundation for numerical operations in Python (arrays, linear algebra, broadcasting).

---

## 🎨 **Data Visualization**

### 🔹 `matplotlib`

* Low-level plotting library (line plots, scatter, bar charts, histograms).

### 🔹 `seaborn`

* High-level interface built on `matplotlib`, ideal for **statistical plots** (heatmaps, pairplots, distributions).

---

## 📊 **Scientific & Statistical Computing**

### 🔹 `scipy`

* Scientific computing package: numerical integration, optimization, signal processing, interpolation, etc.

### 🔹 `statsmodels`

* Advanced **statistical modeling**, including:

  * Regression models (OLS, GLM)
  * Time series (ARIMA)
  * Hypothesis testing

---

## 🎓 **Machine Learning**

### 🔹 `scikit-learn`

* Widely-used ML library:

  * Preprocessing (scaling, encoding)
  * Models (linear regression, decision trees, clustering)
  * Evaluation metrics

---

## 📁 **Excel File Support**

### 🔹 `openpyxl`

* Allows reading/writing Excel `.xlsx` files — often used with `pandas.read_excel()`.

---

## 💻 **Notebooks & Kernel**

### 🔹 `jupyterlab`

* A web-based interactive coding environment for:

  * Writing notebooks
  * Visualizing data
  * Documenting analysis

### 🔹 `ipykernel`

* Backend kernel that runs the code in Jupyter notebooks.

---

## 🧪 `pip`

Adds support for installing Python packages from **PyPI** (not available in Conda).

### 🔸 `pip:` section — packages to be installed via pip:

---

## 🌡️ **Forecasting & Advanced Stats**

### 🔹 `prophet` *(installed via pip)*

* Developed by Facebook (Meta), for **time series forecasting** (daily, weekly, yearly patterns).
* Works well with missing values and holidays.

### 🔹 `pingouin` *(installed via pip)*

* Easy-to-use **statistics package** for:

  * t-tests, ANOVA, correlations, Bayes factors
  * Effect sizes, confidence intervals
  * Great for quick exploratory stats
